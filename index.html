    <h2>JavaScript Statements</h2>

    <p>A <b>JavaScript program</b> is a list of <b>statements</b> to be executed by a computer.</p>
    
    <p id="demo"></p>
    
    <script>
    let x, y, z;  // Statement 1
    x = 5;        // Statement 2
    y = 6;        // Statement 3
    z = x + y;    // Statement 4
    
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
    "The value of z is " + z + ".";  
    </script>

    <!--JavaScript Programs
    
       A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a 
       computer.

        In a programming language, these programming instructions are called 
        statements.

        A JavaScript program is a list of programming statements.

        In HTML, JavaScript programs are executed by the web brows

    -->

    <!--JavaScript Statmesnts
    
        JavaScript statements are composed of:

        Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments.

        This statement tells the browser to write "Hello Dolly." inside an HTML 
        element with id="demo":   
    -->

    <h2>JavaScript Statements</h2>

    <p>In HTML, JavaScript statements are executed by the browser.</p>
    
    <p id="demo"></p>
    
    <script>
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello Dolly.";
    </script>

    <hr>

    <!--Most JavaScript programs contain many JavaScript statements.

        The statements are executed, one by one, in the same order as they are 
        written.

        JavaScript programs (and JavaScript statements) are often called JavaScript 
        code.
    -->

    <!--Semicolons;
    
        Semicolons separate JavaScript statements.

        Add a semicolon at the end of each executable statement:
    -->

    <h2>JavaScript Statements</h2>

    <p>JavaScript statements are separated by semicolons.</p>
    
    <p id="demo1"></p>
    
    <script>
    let a, b, c;
    a = 5;
    b = 6;
    c = a + b;
    document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML = c;
    </script>

    <hr>

    <!--When separated by semicolons, mulitple statements on one line are allowed:-->

    <h2>JavaScript Statements</h2>

    <p>Multiple statements on one line are allowed.</p>
    
    <p id="demo1"></p>
    
    <script>
    let a, b, c;
    a = 5; b = 6; c = a + b;
    document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML = c;
    </script>

    <hr>

    <!--on the web, you might see examples without semicolons.
        Ending statements with semicolon is not required, but hightly recommented.
    -->

    <!--JavaScript White Space
    
        JavaScript ignores multiple spaces. You can add white space to your script to 
        make it more readable.

        The following lines are equivalent:

            let person = "Hege";
            let person = "Hege";

        A good practice is to put spaces around operators (= + - * / ):
            let x = y + z;
    -->

    <!--JavaScript Line Length and Line Breaks
    
        For best readability, programmers often like to avoid code lines longer than 
        80 characters.

        If a JavaScript statement does not fit on one line, the best place to break it 
        is after an operator:
    -->

    <h2>JavaScript Statements</h2>

    <p>
    The best place to break a code line is after an operator or a comma.
    </p>
    
    <p id="demo"></p>
    
    <script>
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
    "Hello Dolly!";
    </script>

    <hr>

    <!--JavaScript Code Blocks
    
        JavaScript statements can be grouped together in code blocks, inside curly brackets {...}.

        The purpose of code blocks is to define statements to be executed together.

        One place you will find statements grouped together in blocks, is in 
        JavaScript functions:
    -->

    <h2>JavaScript Statements</h2>

    <p>JavaScript code blocks are written between { and }</p>
    
    <button type="button" onclick="myFunction()">Click Me!</button>
    
    <p id="demo1"></p>
    <p id="demo2"></p>
    
    <script>
    function myFunction() {
      document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML = "Hello Dolly!";
      document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML = "How are you?";
    }
    </script>

    <!--JavaScript Keywords
    
        JavaScript statements often starts with a keyword to identify the JavaScript
        action to be Performed.

        Here is a list of some of the keywords we will learn about:

            Keyword	            Description
            var	                Declares a variable
            let	                Declares a block variable
            const	            Declares a block constant
            if	                Marks a block of statements to be executed on a condition
            switch	            Marks a block of statements to be executed in different cases
            for	                Marks a block of statements to be executed in a loop
            function	        Declares a function
            return	            Exits a function
            try	                Implements error handling to a block of statements

        JavaScript keywords are reserved words. Reserved words connot be used as
        names for variables.
